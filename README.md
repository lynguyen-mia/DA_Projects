Some projects of mine can be found in this repository:

## SQL
1. [**PostgreSQL_Google Merchandise Store Dataset**](SQL/PostgreSQL_BigQuery_GoogleMerchandiseStore.sql)
<br/>Extracted data for the descriptive analysis, including: cohort comparison; pageview comparison between varied user types; bounce rate by traffic source; summarization of total visits, pageviews, transaction and revenue.

## PowerBI
1. [**PowerBI_Global Superstore Sales Dataset**](PowerBI/PowerBI_GlobalSuperstoreSales.pbix)
<br/>Built sales overview dashboard with varied metrics such as revenue, profit, shopping cart value, sales volume of stores, broken down by regions and products. 
2. [**PowerBI_DebtRecoveryAnalysis**](PowerBI/PowerBI-DebtRecoveryAnalysis.pbix)
<br/>Analyzed debt recovery efficiency of Bank X's partner so that the Head of Collection can make appropriate decisions on debt portfolio allocation and cooperation strategy for the next quarter.

## Python
1. [**Data Wrangling_Ecommerce**](Python/Data Wrangling_Ecommerce.ipynb)
<br/>Transformed raw transactional data using Python, specifically filling NULLs with meaningful values, dropping duplicates, fixing typo errors, adding calculation/categorization columns, merging relevant tables. 
2. [**While Loop With Array Practice**](Python/While loop with array.ipynb)
<br/>Created a program that randomly generate "búa", "kéo", "lá" in every turn. Users choose 1 among "búa", "kéo", "lá" and compare that with the result randomly picked by the program.
3. [**While Loop Practice**](DA_Projects/Python/While loop.ipynb)
<br/>Created a program that randomly generate a number between 1 and 10 every turn. Users choose 1 number and compare that with the result randomly picked by the program. Stop the game after 5 times of incorrectly guessing.
