# DA_Projects
Some projects of mine can be found in this repository:

## SQL
1. **PostgreSQL_Google Merchandise Store Dataset**
<br/>Extracted data for the descriptive analysis, including: cohort comparison; pageview comparison between varied user types; bounce rate by traffic source; summarization of total visits, pageviews, transaction and revenue.

## PowerBI
1. **PowerBI_Global Superstore Sales Dataset**
<br/>Built sales overview dashboard with varied metrics such as revenue, profit, shopping cart value, sales volume of stores, broken down by regions and products. 
2. **PowerBI_DebtRecoveryAnalysis**
<br/>Analyzed debt recovery efficiency of Bank X's partner so that the Head of Collection can make appropriate decisions on debt portfolio allocation and cooperation strategy for the next quarter.

## Python
1. **Data Wrangling_Ecommerce**
<br/>Transformed raw transactional data using Python, specifically filling NULLs with meaningful values, dropping duplicates, fixing typo errors, adding calculation/categorization columns, merging relevant tables. 
2. **While loop with array practice**
<br/>Created a program that randomly generate "búa", "kéo", "lá" in every turn. Users choose 1 among "búa", "kéo", "lá" and compare that with the result randomly picked by the program.
3. **While loop practice**
<br/>Created a program that randomly generate a number between 1 and 10 every turn. Users choose 1 number and compare that with the result randomly picked by the program. Stop the game after 5 times of incorrectly guessing.
